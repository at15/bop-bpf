Got reply on the packet drop issue https://github.com/bpftools/linux-observability-with-bpf/issues/23#issuecomment-594560645

- socket filter actually does not 'filter', i.e. alter the packet ???

> Socket filter programs donâ€™t allow you to modify the contents of those packets or to change the destination for those packets

https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/notes-on-bpf-1 ` BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER`

> Note that we're not trimming or dropping the original packet which would still reach the intended socket intact; we're working with a copy of the packet metadata which raw sockets can access for observability. In addition to filtering packet flow to our socket, we can also do things that have side-effects; for example collecting statistics in BPF maps

http://squidarth.com/networking/systems/rc/2018/05/28/using-raw-sockets.html talks about raw socket (has no port)

- [ ] is raw socket simply duplicating packets?
- [ ] it seems the filter logic only applies to the user space program that read from this raw socket, other applications has no impact ...
  - [ ] what happens if the sk buffer is modified?
