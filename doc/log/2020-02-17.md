  - [survey: System calls in a TCP connection](https://github.com/at15/bop-bpf/issues/1)

So finally started writing bop-bpf ... after a long time. There are several things need to be done

- basic flow of a tcp connection i.e. what system calls are involved
- trace syscall using bpf via bcc, just python loader
- try go bpf and cpp bpf
- a test environment using vagrant

- bind
  - client has implicit `bind` when calling `connect`
  - server needs to make explicit `bind` call
- accept
  - block and waits for incoming connection, returns a new socket descriptor when a connection request is processed
- send
  - four syscalls, `write`, `writev`, `sendto` and `sendmsg`, eventually calls `sosend`
- receive
  - four syscalls (same as write), eventually calls `soreceive`

The flow is

server: socket -> bind -> listen -> accept -> recv/send
client: socket -> connect -> bind (implicit call) -> recv/send

Section 11.3.1 IP Address

- TCP/IP use network byte order **big-endian**, address in IP address structure ``in_addr` are always stored in big endian, uses `htonl` and `ntohl` to convert between different endian.
- `inet_pton` to convert between dot string representation w/ integer
- `/etc/services` keeps a mapping for wellknown ports (including those larger than 1024)
